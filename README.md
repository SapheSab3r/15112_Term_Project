# Plants vs Zombies (15112Project)

## Overview
This is the term project for CMU 15-112: Fundamentals of Programming. In this TP, my goal was to rebuild the popular tower-defense game, Plants vs Zombies using Python, the CMU 112 graphics package and the existing PvsZ characters and graphics. The game was originally developed by PopCap Games and published by Electronic Arts. I will make a simplified version of that, which will only include a few types of plants, zombies, and two levels (the day level and the night level). The player's goal is to successfully defeat waves of zombies using the plants that are provided for each level.

## How to Play

Download the second folder called "Term Project", and there are two py files: "Plants vs Zombies" (the main game file) and "Night-level". Once you have downloaded the folder, ensure to open the entire folder using VScode, and hit the Play button on VSCode on the "Plants vs Zombies" py file. Hope you enjoy this game!
How to run:
Require Python 3.7 or above and cmu_112_graphics (this file is already in the zip folder). 
After opening the zip file, open ‘Plants vs Zombies.py’ then the project can run 

* Use the mouse to collect the sun and select the plant card on the left hand side
* If a card is selected (highlight in yellow) then the player can click on any grid on the lawn to plant the plant
* To remove the plant, click the shovel tool and then click on the plant you want to remove

Game Shortcut:
Press ‘w’ or ‘W’ during the game, which will automatically send the player to the win page. Then clicking on any area of the winning page will set you back to the starting page.
Press ‘l’ or ‘L’ during the game, which will automatically send the player to the losing page, and below will also have the total number of zombies they have just killed.
