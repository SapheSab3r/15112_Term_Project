# Plants vs Zombies (15112Project)

## Overview
This is the term project for CMU 15-112: Fundamentals of Programming. In this TP, my goal was to rebuild the popular tower-defense game, Plants vs Zombies using Python, the CMU 112 graphics package and the existing PvsZ characters and graphics. The game was originally developed by PopCap Games and published by Electronic Arts. I will make a simplified version of that, which will only include a few types of plants, zombies, and two levels (the day level and the night level). The player's goal is to successfully defeat waves of zombies using the plants that are provided for each level.
