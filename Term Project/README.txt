Plants Vs Zombies


Plants vs Zombies is a tower defense game. The game was originally developed by PopCap Games and published by Electronic Arts. The objective of this game is to stop the zombies from reaching the left side of the lawn using the given plants. If the player defeats all the zombies, then they win. Each plant has a unique feature and each plant costs different amounts of sunlight when planting. The plant can be removed, but no sunlight will return. Therefore players need to build their defense cautiously.
